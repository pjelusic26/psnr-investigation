What can we learn about PSNR metric from a zit between the eyes?
----------
1. Zits look really bad when scaled up.
2. If we compare two identical images, PSNR value will be infinite.
3. As the amount of changed pixels rises, PSNR drops.
4. Even for only a small number of changed pixels, PSNR values drop significantly.
